# Bear Upgrade 2.1


## Preflight Check

1. Hardware parts correspond to [bom](bom.md).
1. Printed parts correspond to [bom](bom.md).
1. Verify visually all the printed parts to find defects and imperfections. Clean up if necessary.
1. Check length of build_helper_106mm.stl, should be 106mm long.
1. Check length of the 290mm V-Slot, this is the most important dimension.
1. Check that all identical length V-Slots (like 2x370mm) have the exact same dimension. Adjust them with a file if you see a difference.
1. Disassemble one z-axis-top of your printer and try the bear upgrade version by pushing the smooth rod in the corresponding hole. This helps you verify that your parts have been printed with good calibration. If it is too tight, use a file to increase hole.
1. Do the same as previous point but with z_motor_mount. In this case I recommend to remove the smooth rod. If it is too tight, use a file to increase hole.
1. Having a good square is critical to build the Bear perfectly. I recommend a 200mm long machinist precision square with standard DIN 875. In case you do not want to buy a new square, checkout this video : [youtube.com/watch?v=FNpAQHrNpNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNpAQHrNpNU).
1. Use thread locker like Loctite Blue 243 to secure the screw during the assembly (for metal thread to metal thread, not metal thread to plastic).
1. Maybe something is interesting for you in the [optional parts](/optional_parts.md).


## Disassembly recommendations

1. Prepare some containers to keep all you parts, screws, bolts, etc. from the original printer
1. Unload filament and remove spool holders
1. Unplug everything from the RAMBo board
1. Disassemble RAMBo cover and lid
1. Disassemble the Z axis and keep X axis in one piece (be careful with bearings)
1. Use a tape and marker to identify your Z rods
1. Identify your Z motors, one has shorter cables
1. Disassemble y-belt-idler and remove the belt from the Y motor
1. Finish to disassemble Y axis but keep Y carriage and heated bed in one piece (be careful with bearings)
1. Use a tape and marker to identify your Y rods
1. Disassemble the PSU
1. Disassemble the LCD support, keep only the LCD cover and electronics

Happy building :relaxed:
