## Introduction

The Bear Frame Upgrade improves stiffness and reliability of the original [Prusa i3 MK2(S), MK2.5(S)(S+) and MK3(S)(S+)](https://www.prusa3d.com/). It allows faster prints, increases precision, makes maintenance easier and opens the door to more customisations. Plus it looks unique with our coloured frames!

## Compatibility

This Bear Frame Upgrade 2.1 is compatible with the Full Bear Frame Upgrade 2.0 __MK3__ frame. If you do not know which frame you have please check [our FAQ here](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Wiki/Bear_FAQ#Section_Which_Full_Bear_frame_do_I_have). The 2.1 version needs extra hardware (screws, nuts, washers, dowel pin), check the [bill of materials](doc/bom.md) for more details. You can also order hardware upgrade kit from our [distributor websites](#where-can-i-get-an-official-kit).

:bulb: If you have a Full Bear Frame Upgrade 2.0 MK2S or MK2.5 frame you can find compatible parts in the [optional parts section](#optional-parts) below.

:warning: The new Y and Z axis are __not__ compatible with any of the existing Prusa or Bear 2.0 parts. You have to update all parts from Bear 2.1.

:warning: The original Prusa firmware is compatible with the Bear Upgrade 2.1 only if you use the Original Prusa extruder and X axis. If you use the Bear upgrade 2.1 frame with BearExxa, BearMera or Bondtech extruders you will need to use custom firmware.
